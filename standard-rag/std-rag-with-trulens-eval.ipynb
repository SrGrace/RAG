      "Bartenders can make varying amounts of money based on several factors such as location, hourly wages, and tips earned. In high-volume resorts or establishments, bartenders can earn between $50,000 to $75,000 per year, including both hourly wages and tips. However, in restaurants, the median salary rate for bartenders can be around $73,000 per year. On average, bartenders make about $2 to $3 an hour in wages, but they mostly rely on tips, which can range from $20 to $300 or more per night. The amount of money a bartender can make ultimately depends on various factors, including the popularity of the bar, the quality of service, and the level of conversation they provide to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information provided, it seems that bartenders in smaller towns may earn less than those working in larger cities or popular tourist destinations. For instance, in a town with a population of 2000, a bartender might earn a total of $100 to $200 per night (on a good night), depending on the number of customers and the amount of tip money received.\n",
